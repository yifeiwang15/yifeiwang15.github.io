abstract: "The versatility of multimodal deep learning holds tremendous promise for ad- vancing scientific research and practical applications. As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transfor- mative innovations, leading us to new frontiers in chemical understanding and discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML) as a novel approach tailored for molecules, showcasing its potential to advance the field of chemistry. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmet- ric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molec- ular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet. ACML exhibits its capability to revolutionize chemical research and applications, providing a deeper understanding of the chemical semantics of different modalities."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We proposed an asymmetric contrastive multimodal learning framework, an effective and training-efficient framework tailored for molecules, promoting cross-modality understanding between the molecular graph and other chemical modalities.

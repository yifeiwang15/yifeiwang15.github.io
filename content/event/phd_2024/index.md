title: Oral Presentation of My Dissertation Proposal at CS PhD Retreat

event: Brandeis CS PhD Retreat 2024
event_url: 

location: Brandeis University
address:
  city: Waltham
  region: MA
  country: United States

summary: 'Better AI in Scientific Applications: Interdisciplinary Approaches for Advancing Representational Learning'
abstract: 'View A: Designing novel model architectures that can effectively capture and represent the complexities inherent in scientific data.  Project 1: Novel algebraic learning framework for knowledge graph with incorporation of human-defined logic rules. Project 2: Novel motif-based learning framework for molecule property prediction. View B: Multimodal approaches to integrate complementary knowledge from different modalities. Project 3: Multimodal contrastive learning using heterogeneous molecule representations. Project 4: A multimodal fusion approach for integrating molecular learning with language models via soft prompting. View C: Controllable molecule generation. Project 5: Controllable Molecule Generation by Diffusion Language Model'
